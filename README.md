## Problem Statement

ElecKart is an e-commerce firm based out of Ontario, Canada specialising in electronic products. To enhance their revenues, over the past one year, they had done a significant investing in their marketing efforts. They are about to create a marketing budget for the upcoming year, which will include TV commercials, online campaigns, price optimizations, promotional strategies, etc. They want to relocate their budget optimally across different marketing levers to improve the revenue response using Market Mix Modelling.

The objective of the project is to create a market mix model for 3 product sub-categories - Camera accessory, Gaming accessory and Home Audio - to observe the actual impact of various marketing variables over one year (July 2015 to June 2016) and recommend the optimal budget allocation for different marketing levers for the next year.
